## Features

The User Form App server provides the following functionality:

1. **API Endpoints**: The server exposes API endpoints to handle form submissions. These endpoints allow clients to send user information and store it in the MongoDB database.

2. **Data Persistence**: User form submissions are saved in the MongoDB database, ensuring that the data is stored securely and can be accessed later if needed.



## Technologies Used

The User Form App server utilizes the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: The server is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side execution of JavaScript code.

- **Express**: Express is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is used to create the server and handle HTTP requests and responses.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for data storage. It is used to store user form submissions in this application.

## Usage

To run the User Form App server locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

4. Configure the MongoDB connection

5. Start the server: `npm start`

   The server will start running on the default port 3000 unless configured otherwise. You can access the server API endpoints using tools like Postman or by integrating them into the client application.
